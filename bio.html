				<h2>Hi. I like computers.</h2>
				<p>I've always loved computers, and they've been a hobby of mine for most of my life. When I was in junior high, I built my first computer and haven't stopped. When I was in high school, I taught myself some HTML and CSS and ran several websites for friends. Into college, I remained enthusiastic about computers, but my education took a different path.<br><br>

				I wasn't sure what to major in, so I ended up as Communications major (basically a business degree). At that time, I was in my university taiko drumming group. By my senior year, I made the decision to start saving up and move to Japan.<br><br>

				I've always wanted to see the world, and Japan seemed like a good place to start. I moved to Japan in November of 2015 and began teaching English. After a few years of teaching, I realized I don't really like it all that much.<br><br>

				Now I'm ready to switch careers. I'm aiming to be either a front-end or full-stack developer.<br><br>

				In April 2021, I'll be starting the full-stack development bootcamp at Le Wagon in Tokyo. When I graduate in June, I'll hit the ground running.<br><br>
